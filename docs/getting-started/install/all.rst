Brightspot provides tools and resources tailored to frontend and backend development. 
If you only need to focus on client-side development, you can set up a frontend development environment that excludes the Brightspot platform. 

Backend development requires the Brightspot platform and other components. The quick setup requires minimal steps. Most prerequisite software is installed and configured for you, and the Brightspot platform is automatically deployed and started.
On the other hand, the manual setup requires that you install and configure the prerequisite software, and deploy the Brightspot platform. 

Both frontend and backend development enviornments include Styleguide, a development platform for creating, testing, and validating frontends. Although Styleguide is included with the backend development enviornment, its use requires no backend components.
