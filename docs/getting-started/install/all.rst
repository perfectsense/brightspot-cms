Developer Installation
########################

.. I don't know if Dev wants the frontend procedure here. Also, from Dev's POV, what is the difference between the quick install and the manual install. To me it's 2 things: quick install is much faster install; manual install is easier to update because it's not in virtual enviornment.

Brightspot offers two ways to get started. The Quick Installation requires minimal effort to install and start the Brightspot platform. To create a full Brightspot project, follow the Manual Installation instructions.

If you only need to focus on client-side development, you can set up a frontend development environment that excludes the Brightspot platform.  Both frontend and backend development enviornments include Styleguide, a development platform for creating, testing, and validating frontends. Although Styleguide is included with the backend development enviornment, its use requires no backend components.
