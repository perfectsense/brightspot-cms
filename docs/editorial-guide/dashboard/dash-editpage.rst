Using the Dashboard Edit Page
==========================================

Use this page to create new shared dashboards or to edit existing ones. A dashboard is a versionable content type, consisting of current and past revisions. The live revision is currently available for use by all Brightspot users. Past revisions are previously shared versions. A dashboard cannot have draft revisions.

Shared revisions cannot be modified or deleted. However, a past revision can be compared to other shared revisions, modified, and saved as a new shared revision. Past revisions can also be renamed.

A shared dashboard can be archived, making it unavailable for use. An archived dashboard can be restored for use or permanently deleted, removing all revisions of the dashboard from the Brightspot database.

**To create a shared dashboard:**

#. Define the dashboard tabs and set the widgets layout in each tab.

   A dashboard consists of a required main tab and optional additional tabs. Starting with the **Main** tab in the Dashboard pane, enter a name and create a widget layout. For additional tabs in your dashboard, click the **Tabs** tab.

   You can add as many columns as you need with the **Dashboard Column** buttons. For each column, set the width of the column and the widgets to inhabit it.


   Column widths are entered as relative ratios or percentages. For example, in a three-column dashboard, assigning each column a width of "1" will produce the same result as a width of "33": each column will occupy a third of the screen. Similarly, in a two-column dashboard, assigning the left column a width of "1" and the right column a width of "2" will yield the same results as "33" and "66", respectively. By default, or if the Width is left blank, columns will divide the available space equally.

   Click the name of the desired widget to add it to a column. Reorder widgets in a column by dragging and dropping. You can also drag and drop widgets between different columns.

   You can add the same widget to your dashboard in multiple locations. For example, with two Recent Activity widgets on your dashboard, you could leave one filtered to display just your activity, and the other could show all activity on the site.

#. Optional: Set the **S**\earch **E**\ngine **O**\ptimization options in the **SEO** tab.

   Use the :doc:`SEO widget <../seo/all>` to enhance the searchability of your shared dashboard.

#. Click **Save**.

   The first version of the shared dashboard is created and is immediately available for use by all Brightspot users. In addition, the Revisions widget appears, identifying the version that you just saved as **Live**.


**To edit a shared dashboard revision:**

#. From the Revisions widget, click the version that you want to modify.

   By default, the **Live** revision is selected. You can modify the current or past revision.

   To compare a past revision with the current one, click the previous version. The **Side By Side** tab is displayed. The past version is shown on the left and the most current version on the right. To make changes to the past version, go to the **Edit** tab.

#. Click **Save**.

   A new version is created and is immediately available for use by all Brightspot users.


**To rename a dashboard revision:**

#. From the Revisions widget, click a past published version to rename.

#. From the Save widget, click **Name Revision** and enter a descriptive name.

   The new name is reflected in the Revisions widget.

         :height: 241px


**To archive a dashboard:**

#. From the Revisions widget, select the **Live** version.

#. From the Publish widget, select **Archive**.

   The live version is removed from the web site. You can restore the live version, making it again available on the web site. Alternatively, you can permanently delete all versions of the dashboard item from the Brightspot database.
