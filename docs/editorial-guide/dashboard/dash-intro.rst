==================
Custom Dashboards
==================

The CMS provides a default system dashboard that is global in scope; that is, it is available to all users of the system.
If you have the required permission, you can customize the default system dashboard. You can also create dashboards that are less than global in scope. In addition, you can customize a dashboard and share it with all Brightspot users, or you can create a one-off dashboard that only you can use.
