Working with One-off Dashboards
================================

Unlike a shared dashboard, a one-off dashboard is limited for use by the creator only. A one-off dashboard can be modified, but it cannot be versioned or archived. If you replace a one-off dashboard with another dashboard, the replaced dashboard is permanently deleted by the system. 

**To create a one-off dashboard:**

#. At the applicable system level, navigate to the **Dashboard** window.

#. From the **Dashboard** drop-down menu, click **One Off**.

   The configuration options appear.

#. Define the dashboard tabs and set the widgets layout in each tab.

   A dashboard consists of a required main tab and optional additional tabs. Starting with the **Main** tab in the Dashboard pane, enter a name and create a widget layout. For additional tabs in your dashboard, click the **Tabs** tab.

   You can add as many columns as you need with the **Dashboard Column** buttons. For each column, set the width of the column and the widgets to inhabit it.


   Column widths are entered as relative ratios or percentages. For example, in a three-column dashboard, assigning each column a width of "1" will produce the same result as a width of "33": each column will occupy a third of the screen. Similarly, in a two-column dashboard, assigning the left column a width of "1" and the right column a width of "2" will yield the same results as "33" and "66", respectively. By default, or if the Width is left blank, columns will divide the available space equally.

   Click the name of the desired widget to add it to a column. Reorder widgets in a column by dragging and dropping. You can also drag and drop widgets between different columns.

   You can add the same widget to your dashboard in multiple locations. For example, with two Recent Activity widgets on your dashboard, you could leave one filtered to display just your activity, and the other could show all activity on the site.
