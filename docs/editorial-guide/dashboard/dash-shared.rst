Working with Shared Dashboards
--------------------------------

A shared dashboard is available for use by all Brightspot users. It be created by any user who has the required dashboard permission.

A shared dashboard is a versionable content type.
A newly created dashboard is the first version of the dashboard item. The version goes "live" in the sense that it is immediately available for selection by other users. If the first version of the dashboard is modified, saving the changes results in a second version, which automatically becomes the live version. Subsequent dashboard modifications result in additional dashboard versions.

Shared dashboard versions are created and modified in the Dashboard Edit page, which includes the Revisions widget. The live version of the dashboard and all past versions are listed in the Revisions widget. A past version can be compared to the current version, modified, and saved, making it the live version.

A dashboard item can be archived, which removes the dashboard from use but keeps it in the database. An archived dashboard can be restored for use or deleted permanently from the database. 

**To work with a shared dashboard:**

#. At the applicable system level, navigate to the **Dashboard** window.
