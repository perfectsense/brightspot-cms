Creating New Content 
================================

To start the publishing process, create a new instance of a predefined content type, such as an article or section.

**Prerequisite**

The content type of interest must be listed on the Common Content widget on the main Dashboard page. Adding content types to the Common Content widget is a :ref:`dashboard configuration option <db-config-anchor>`.


**To create new content:**

1. From the Common Content widget, click the content type for which you want to create a new instance.

   The Content Edit page appears, containing the Publish widget.

2. Add content for the type.

From this point, you can save content as an initial draft, the typical action for new content. However, the widget also provides options to start a workflow or to publish the content to a live site.
