================================
Deleting or Archiving Content
================================

Depending on your role and permissions, you can delete individual draft revisions, delete all draft revisions at one time, and archive, restore or delete a published content item. You cannot delete previously published versions individually because they provide an historical record of the content item. 

A published content item consists of a live version and, typically, past draft and published versions. Deleting the content item removes all versions of the content, draft and published, in one operation. This is a permanent delete, removing all versions from the database.

As an alternative to deleting a content item permanently, you can archive it. Available only for published content, the archiving operation removes the live content from a web site, but keeps it and all associated versions in the Brightspot database. Archived content can be restored, making the content live again on the front end of your site. 


**To archive content:**

#. From the Revisions widget, select the **Live** version.

#. From the Publish widget, select **Archive**.

   The live version is removed from the web site. You can restore the live version, making it again available on the web site, or you can irretrievably delete all versions of the content item from the Brightspot database.
