Saving Draft Content
================================

You can save content as a draft, an action which persists the content to the Brightspot database but does not publish it to the web site. You can create multiple drafts of a content item. In addition, each transition through a workflow is saved as a draft revision. 

A draft can be edited, previewed, published, or deleted. Draft content remains in that state until you publish it, at which time the content goes live immediately, replacing previously published content. 


**Note**: When working with draft revisions, make sure that you save edits before navigating away from the Content Edit page or closing the browser tab.

On the Content Edit page, the Revisions widget includes all drafts in the total list of revisions for a particular content item. On the main Dashboard page, the Unpublished Drafts widget lists all of unpublished drafts for every content item on the site.

You can create drafts from new content that has not yet been published, or from currently published (live) content.


**To create drafts from new content:**

1. Use the Publish widget to save new content in an initial draft.

      :width: 310px
      :height: 290px


   You can publish the initial draft or route it through a workflow. Or you can use the Revisions widget to create additional drafts, which can then be compared to and merged into the initial draft.


2. Use the Revisions widget to create a second draft and to give it a name.


  With new, unpublished content, the Content Editor provides a side-by-side comparison between the initial draft and any additional draft that is currently selected (not shown). Additionally, the Publish widget provides the option of merging the content of an additional draft with the content of the initial draft.

**To create drafts from live content:**

1. | From the Revisions widget, select **Live**.


2. Use either the Publish widget or the Revisions widget to create a new draft.

   **Publish widget:**

   a. Modify the live version.
\
   b. In the Publish widget, click **Save Draft**.

   **Revisions widget:**

   a. | In the Revisions widget, click **New Draft** and name the draft.
      | The new draft is created with the content of the live version.

   b. Modify the draft.

   c. In the Publish widget, click **Save**.

The following example indicates that two post-publication drafts have been created, one with the Publish widget and the other with the Revisions widget.

     :width: 427px
     :height: 465px

Note that with previously published content, the Content Editor provides a side-by-side comparison between the live revision and the draft that is currently selected.
