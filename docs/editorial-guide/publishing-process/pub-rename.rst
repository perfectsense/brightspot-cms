Renaming Revisions
================================

You can rename past published revisions, allowing you to provide a more descriptive identifier than the system-default name.

**To rename a revision:**

#. From the Revisions widget, click a past published version to rename.

#. From the Publish widget, click **Name Revision** and enter a name.
   
   In the following example, two past published revisions are renamed.
