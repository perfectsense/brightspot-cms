   Brightspot Platform
      A digital experience platform for building scaleable content management and asset management applications, as well as a platform for integrating other publishing systems, such as video, social media, and CRM. Brightspot can be used as a publishing platform for websites and native mobile applications, or as an application backend.

      Java-based, Brightspot was built using the Dari Framework, an object persistence library for building complex content types and persisting them to a database. Both Brightspot and Dari are open-source projects.


   Content Management System (CMS)
      Web-based application for creating and publishing content. Highly customizable, the CMS is built from the Brightspot platform. The CMS provides a widget-based dashbord for creating, managing, and publishing content. Core functionality includes a rich text editor, live preview, full-text search, and debugging tools. Several plugins are provided to expand functionality and integration with third-party web services.

   Dari Framework
      An object persistence library and data-modeling tool, used to build complex content types and persist them to one or more databases. Dari enables developers to query databases, as well as to create and modify custom data structures from within the same access layer. A data model can be altered by modifying the Java classes that define it, without regard to database schema or other configurations.


   Media Desk
     Asset manager built from the Brightspot platform.



   Publish widget
    A widget on the Content Edit page used to publish content to a live web site. It is used in conjunction with the Revisions widget.

   Revision
    A single version of a content item, which can be either a published (live) version, a previously published version, or a draft (never published). A revision is associated with a content item. For example, from the Article content type, you can instantiate a content item called "How the West was Won." The initial instance is one revision, and an unlimited number of subsequent revisions can be created and associated with the "How the West was Won" content item.
   
   Revisions widget
